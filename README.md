# Library
An online dynamic library that loads the folder and file structure of the targeted Share Drive and publishes on the website automatically. Also, automatically changes the website content when the content in Share Drive is changed. If a new file or folder is added or deleted in the Share Drive, the changes automatically will be published on website in the same structure as it is on Share Drive. Files posted can be viewed and downloaded from the site. This sample represents only a part from the original project which is used as a Share Point to share the company documents internally over the web.

Developed using PHP, JS & AJAX.
